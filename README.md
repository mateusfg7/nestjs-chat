# Chatterbox - NestJS Real-time Chat Application

Chatterbox is a real-time chat application built with NestJS, designed for scalability and maintainability. It features WebSocket communication, JWT-based authentication, and a PostgreSQL database backend.

---

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging:** Utilizes WebSockets (_Socket.IO_) for instant message delivery.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Leverages Redis with `@socket.io/redis-adapter` for multi-instance WebSocket scaling.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure JWT-based authentication (access and refresh tokens) using RSA keys.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL managed with TypeORM, including support for migrations.
- **API Documentation:** Swagger (OpenAPI) integration for easy API exploration and testing.
- **Configuration Management:** Flexible configuration using `@nestjs/config` and `.env` files.
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging with Winston.
- **Input Validation:** Uses `class-validator` and `class-transformer` for robust request validation.
- **Structured Codebase:** Follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns (application, infrastructure, presentation layers).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) _(The project uses pnpm v11)_
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) _(for generating RSA keys)_

**If running locally (without Docker):**

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (v13.x or later)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (v6.x or later)

**If using Docker (Recommended):**

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd nestjs-chat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Copy the example environment file and update it with your local configuration:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` with your specific settings (database credentials, ports, key paths, etc.). See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details.

4. **Generate RSA Keys for Authentication:**

   The application uses RSA keys for signing and verifying JWTs. Use the provided Makefile to generate them:

   ```bash
   make generate_keys
   ```

   This will create a `keys/` directory with `access_private.key`, `access_public.key`, `refresh_private.key`, and `refresh_public.key`. Ensure the paths in your `.env` file (`AUTH_ACCESS_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH`, `AUTH_ACCESS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, etc.) point to these generated keys (e.g., `keys/access_private.key`).

5. **Set up the Database:**

   If you are running the application locally (without Docker), ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible with the credentials provided in your `.env` file.

   Run database migrations to create the necessary tables:

   ```bash
   pnpm migration:run
   ```

   _(**Note:** If using Docker Compose, you will run migrations inside the container as shown in the next section.)_

---

## Running the Application

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the application along with its dependencies (PostgreSQL and Redis) is using Docker Compose.

1. Ensure your `.env` file is set up and RSA keys are generated (`make generate_keys`).
2. Run Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Run database migrations inside the container:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec chatterbox pnpm migration:run
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:<PORT>` (as defined in your `.env`, default is `3000`).

### Running Locally (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run the application on your host machine, ensure PostgreSQL and Redis are running locally and configured in your `.env` file.

- **Development Mode (with hot-reloading):**

  ```bash
  pnpm start:dev
  ```

- **Production Mode:**

  ```bash
  pnpm build
  pnpm start:prod
  ```

- **Debugging Mode:**

  ```bash
  pnpm start:debug
  ```

---

## Running Tests

- **Run all tests:**

  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```

- **Run tests in watch mode:**

  ```bash
  pnpm test:watch
  ```

- **Run tests with coverage report:**

  ```bash
  pnpm test:cov
  ```

- **Run End-to-End (E2E) tests:**

  ```bash
  pnpm test:e2e
  ```

## API Documentation

Swagger API documentation is available once the application is running. Navigate to:

`http://localhost:<PORT>/swagger`

_(Replace `<PORT>` with the HTTP port specified in your `.env` file)._

## Key Generation (`Makefile`)

The `Makefile` provides convenient commands for managing RSA keys used for JWT authentication:

- **`make generate_keys`**: Generates new RSA private and public key pairs for both access and refresh tokens. It will create them in the `keys/` directory. If keys already exist, it will prompt an error; use `make delete_keys` first.
- **`make delete_keys`**: Deletes the `keys/` directory and all its contents.
- **`make help`**: Displays available Makefile commands.

## Project Structure

A brief overview of the main directories in `src/`:

- **`src/main.ts`**: Application entry point, initializes NestJS app, Swagger, WebSocket adapter, etc.
- **`src/app.module.ts`**: Root module of the application.
- **`src/application/`**: Contains core business logic, services, and use cases for different domains (e.g., `auth`, `chat`, `user`).
- **`src/common/`**: Shared utilities, decorators, enums, constants, and base classes used across the application.
- **`src/infrastructure/`**: Handles external concerns like database interactions (TypeORM entities, repositories), third-party service integrations (Redis, logging), and WebSocket adapters.
- **`src/presentation/`**: Manages how the application interacts with the outside world. Includes HTTP controllers, WebSocket gateways, Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), and guards.
